/**
 * Bracket-notation parser for query strings and urlencoded form bodies,
 * the `parse_str()`/`qs` behaviour every HTTP client already assumes.
 *
 * Without it, `?ids[]=1&ids[]=2` arrives as the single string-keyed entry
 * `{"ids[]": "1"}` and `user[name]=bob` as `{"user[name]": "bob"}`, which
 * has two consequences beyond ugliness:
 *
 *  - a validation rule of `array()` on a query field can never pass,
 *    because no query field is ever an array; and
 *  - the second `ids[]` value is silently discarded, so a filter over
 *    three ids quietly becomes a filter over one.
 *
 * Both are the kind of bug that looks like an application error for a
 * long time before anyone suspects the framework.
 *
 * The supported syntax, matching PHP/Laravel and `qs`:
 *
 *   ids[]=1&ids[]=2          → { ids: ["1", "2"] }
 *   ids[0]=1&ids[1]=2        → { ids: ["1", "2"] }
 *   user[name]=bob           → { user: { name: "bob" } }
 *   user[address][city]=x    → { user: { address: { city: "x" } } }
 *   a=1&a=2                  → { a: "2" }          (last wins, as PHP)
