/**
 * Lightweight base for class-based controllers. Ships with **no
 * behaviour** — it exists purely so applications can build inheritance
 * chains (e.g. `CreatePostController extends ApiController extends
 * Controller`) and share whatever a project needs on its own base. All the
 * framework requires of a subclass is a `handle()` method.
 *
 *   export class GetPostController extends Controller {
 *     async handle(request: Request) {
 *       const post = await request.model(Post);
 *       return HttpResponse.json(await new PostResource(post).toJson());
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * A controller may **declare a Form Request** by assigning `request`. When
 * set, the framework upgrades the incoming request to that subclass and,
 * before `handle()` runs, calls its `authorize()` (opt-in, Laravel order:
 * authorize → 403, then validate → 422). `handle()` then receives the
 * fully-validated, typed request:
 *
 *   export class CreatePostController extends Controller<CreatePostRequest> {
 *     request = CreatePostRequest;
 *     async handle(request: CreatePostRequest) {
 *       const { body } = request.validated();
 *       ...
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * Controllers reach services through the existing facades (`Auth`,
 * `authorize`, `Events`, …) — there is no constructor DI, keeping the base
 * dependency-free. A fresh instance is constructed per request.
 */

 * Normalise a controller class into a `RouteHandler` the router can mount.

 * declared Form Request (if any), then runs the Laravel-ordered pipeline:
 * `prepareForValidation()` → `authorize()` (→ 403) → validation (→ 422)
 * → `handle()`.
 *
 * `prepareForValidation()` runs FIRST, matching Laravel's
 * `ValidatesWhenResolvedTrait`. Running it after `authorize()` would break
 * the ordinary case of a request that merges a route param or the current
 * user into the input and then authorizes against it — `authorize()` would
 * see the un-prepared bag and deny a request it should allow.
