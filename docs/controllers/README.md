# Controllers

Mahi controllers are **single-action**. One class, one route, one `handle()`
method. There are no `index`/`store`/`show`/`update`/`destroy` resource
controllers and no route-to-method string references.

```ts
import { Controller, HttpResponse, type Request } from "@mahi/http";
import { Post } from "../../models/post.model.js";
import { PostResource } from "../resources/post.resource.js";

export class GetPostController extends Controller {
  async handle(request: Request) {
    const post = await request.model(Post);
    return HttpResponse.json(await new PostResource(post).toJson());
  }
}
```

```ts
router.get("/posts/{post}", GetPostController).name("posts.show");
```

Generate one with `./artisan make:controller`.

## The base class

```ts
export abstract class Controller<R extends Request = Request> {
  request?: RequestClass<R>;
  abstract handle(request: R): ResponseInput | Promise<ResponseInput>;
}
```

That's the entire class. It ships with **no behaviour** — no helper
methods, no injected services, no constructor. It exists so applications
can build their own inheritance chains and put whatever they want on their
own base:

```ts
abstract class ApiController extends Controller {
  protected ok(data: unknown) {
    return HttpResponse.json({ data });
  }
}

export class ShowController extends ApiController {
  async handle() {
    return this.ok({ id: 1 });
  }
}
```

`handle()` may return anything assignable to `ResponseInput`: a framework
`HttpResponse` (or `JsonResponse`/`FileResponse`/`RedirectResponse`) or a
platform `Response`. See [Responses](../responses/).

`isControllerClass(value)` is how the router tells a controller class from
a plain handler function — it checks `value.prototype instanceof Controller`.
That's why extending `Controller` is required rather than merely having a
`handle` method.

## Declaring a form request

Set the `request` property to a `Request` subclass and the framework
upgrades the incoming request to it, authorizes, and validates before
`handle()` runs:

```ts
export class CreatePostController extends Controller<CreatePostRequest> {
  request = CreatePostRequest;

  async handle(request: CreatePostRequest) {
    const { body, images } = request.validated();
    // body: string, images: File[] | undefined
    // …
  }
}
```

The generic parameter is what types `handle()`'s argument and, through it,
`request.validated()`. Writing `Controller<CreatePostRequest>` without
`request = CreatePostRequest` compiles but does nothing at runtime — the
property is the runtime signal; the generic is the compile-time one. Keep
them in sync.

## The per-request pipeline

`controllerToHandler(ControllerClass)` normalizes a controller class into
the `RouteHandler` the router mounts. Per request, in exactly this order:

```ts
return async (request: Request) => {
  const instance = new ControllerClass();
  const typed = instance.request ? instance.request.fromExisting(request) : request;

  const allowed = await typed.authorize();
  if (allowed === false) throw HttpError.forbidden();

  if (Object.keys(typed.rules()).length > 0) {
    await typed.validateOrFail();
  }

  return instance.handle(typed);
};
```

### 1. Construct a fresh instance

`new ControllerClass()` — no arguments, every request.

**There is no constructor dependency injection.** The `ControllerClass`
type is `new () => Controller<R>`, so the container never has to guess what
a constructor parameter means. Controllers reach services through the
existing facades and helpers (`Auth`, `authorize()`, `Events`, `Bus`,
`URL`), or `app().make(TOKEN)` for anything else. This keeps the base
class dependency-free and resolution readable — see the "explicit
resolution, no decorators" principle in the [overview](../).

### 2. Upgrade the request

If `instance.request` is set, `RequestClass.fromExisting(request)` produces
the subclass instance. It copies every parsed bag **by reference**: the
input bag, file bag, header bag, the shared bag, and the model cache. It
also takes over the Hono context's cached-request slot, so anything
downstream that calls `requestFromContext(c)` gets the upgraded instance.

The practical consequence: `request.model(Post)` inside the form request's
`authorize()` and inside `handle()` share one cache entry and hit the
database once.

If `instance.request` is unset, the base `Request` is passed straight
through.

### 3. Authorize

```ts
const allowed = await typed.authorize();
if (allowed === false) throw HttpError.forbidden();
```

`Request.authorize()` **defaults to returning `true`**, so a request that
doesn't override it falls straight through.

**Only an explicit `false` throws.** `undefined`, `void`, and `true` all
pass. That's deliberate: `@mahi/authorization`'s `authorize(ability, …)`
returns `Promise<void>` and throws on denial, so delegating to it works
without the framework second-guessing the return value:

```ts
override authorize() {
  return authorize("create", Post);   // Promise<void> — throws, never returns false
}
```

Throwing `HttpError.forbidden()` yourself works identically.

### 4. Validate

```ts
await typed.prepareInput();      // prepareForValidation()
const allowed = await typed.authorize();
if (allowed === false) throw HttpError.forbidden();
await typed.validateOrFail();
```

Validation is **skipped entirely** when `rules()` is empty — no `Validator`
is constructed. A failure throws `ValidationException`, which the central
error handler renders as `422` with a per-field `errors` bag.

### Why prepare runs before authorize

`prepareForValidation()` is where a request normalizes its own input —
lowercasing an email, merging a route param or the current user. Running
it after `authorize()` (as the pipeline previously did, because it was
buried inside `validate()`) means authorization inspects the *raw* bag,
so a request that authorizes against something it merged is denied when
it should be allowed. Laravel prepares first for the same reason.

### Why authorize runs before validate

This is Laravel's order, and it's the right one. A request that isn't
allowed to perform the action gets a `403` regardless of whether its payload
was well-formed. Validating first would tell an unauthorized caller which
fields your endpoint accepts and which of their values were malformed —
free schema reconnaissance for someone who was never going to be permitted
through.

The framework's own test asserts this: an invalid *and* unauthorized
request returns `403`, not `422`.

### Status codes

| Stage | Failure | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `authorize()` returns `false` | `HttpError.forbidden()` | `403` |
| `authorize()` throws `HttpError` | that error's status | its own |
| `validateOrFail()` | `ValidationException` | `422` |
| `handle()` throws `HttpError` | that error's status | its own |
| `handle()` throws anything else | logged, generic | `500` |

See [error handling](../responses/#error-handling) for exact body shapes.

## Why a fresh instance per request

The container never caches controller instances. Every request constructs
its own.

Node keeps a single process alive across every concurrent request. A
long-lived controller instance would share mutable state between them — a
`private currentUser` assigned in one request is visible to another that
interleaves at the next `await`. That's not a theoretical race; it's the
default outcome, and the bug it produces (one user's data in another user's
response) is the worst class of bug an application framework can make easy.

Construction is cheap: an empty object with a prototype. The alternative —
singleton controllers with a discipline of "never store request state on
`this`" — trades a free allocation for a rule that only holds until someone
forgets it.

If a controller genuinely needs expensive per-instance setup, that's a
signal the work belongs in a service bound as a singleton in a
[provider](../providers/) and resolved inside `handle()`.

## Both authorization styles

Authorization on the form request, when the check needs no loaded model:

```ts
export class CreatePostRequest extends Request {
  override authorize() {
    return authorize("create", Post);
  }
  rules() { /* … */ }
}
```

Authorization in the controller, when it does:

```ts
export class DeletePostController extends Controller {
  async handle(request: Request) {
    const existing = await request.model(Post);
    await authorize("delete", Post, existing);

    await Post.delete(existing.id);
    return HttpResponse.json({ deleted: true });
  }
}
```

The second form runs after the model fetch, which the request-level hook
can't easily do without duplicating the query — though the model cache
means it wouldn't actually cost a second round trip if you did.

## A worked example

```ts
// src/http/requests/register.request.ts
export class RegisterRequest extends Request {
  rules() {
    return {
      name: rule().string().required().min(1),
      email: rule().string().email().required().unique(User, "email"),
      password: rule().string().required().min(8),
    } as const;
  }
}

// src/http/controllers/register.controller.ts
export class RegisterController extends Controller<RegisterRequest> {
  request = RegisterRequest;

  async handle(request: RegisterRequest) {
    const payload = request.validated();
    // { name: string; email: string; password: string }

    const user = (await User.create({
      name: payload.name,
      email: payload.email,
      password: await Hash.make(payload.password),
      deleted_at: null,
    })) as UserTable;

    const guard = Auth.guard("token") as TokenGuard<UserTable>;
    const { token } = await guard.createToken(user.id, "registration");

    return HttpResponse.json({ user: new UserResource(user).toJson(), token }, 201);
  }
}

// src/routes/auth.routes.ts
router.group("/auth", (auth) => {
  auth.post("/register", RegisterController)
    .middleware(throttle("register"))
    .name("auth.register");
});
```

`request.validated()` is fully typed from `RegisterRequest.rules()` — no
casts, no `as`, no separate DTO interface. See
[typed output](../validation/#typed-output) for how.

## Plain function handlers

Controllers aren't mandatory. A route target may be any
`(request: Request) => ResponseInput | Promise<ResponseInput>`:

```ts
router.get("/health", () => HttpResponse.json({ ok: true }));
router.get("/storage/*", servePublicDisk("public"));
```

Function handlers get none of the pipeline — no form-request upgrade, no
`authorize()`, no validation. They're right for trivial endpoints and for
handlers a package hands you pre-built.
